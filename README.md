# Sea-level-predictor
# This project looks at sea level data per year, starting from year 1880 and ending at year 2013. The goal is to visualize each data point with a scatter plot, plot the line of best fit to predict the sea level at year 2050 based on the data only until year 2000, then to plot a line of best fit to predict the sea level at year 2050 based on the of data points until year 2013.
