# Sea-level-predictor
# This project looks at sea level data per year, starting from year 1880 and ending at year 2013. The goal is to visualize each data point with a scatter plot, plot the line of best fit for the data, then to plot a line of best fit to predict the sea level rise until year 2050 (based off the of data points since year 2013).
