# Sea-level-predictor
# This project is the from free code camp Data Anlysis with Python program. The goal is to examine sea level data, starting at year 1880 and ending at year 2013. The goal is to visualize each data point with a scatter plot, plot the line of best fit to predict the sea level at year 2050 based on the data only until year 2000, then to plot a line of best fit to predict the sea level at year 2050 based on the of data points until year 2013.
